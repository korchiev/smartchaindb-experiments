-	analysis_chart.xlsx file contains all the experimental data and plots
   
      o	CAPs page in spreadsheet contains the results of the 4 experiments both on Smart Contract and SmartchainDB. In each experiment the number of capabilities were changed. The transactions number was kept constant: 20RFQs, 25 BIDs per RFQ (500 total BIDs), 1 CREATEs per 1 BID (500 total) and 20 ACCEPTs, 1 ACCEPT per RFQ. 
   
       o	tx-num page contains the results of 3 experiments were number of transactions was changed with each experiment but the number of capabilities were kept constant (30 CAPs). 20-25 in the # of Txs column means 20 RFQs and 25BIDs per RFQ and subsequently 25 CREATEs per RFQ and 20 ACCEPTs. Following the same logic 100-25 means 100 RFQs, 25 BIDs per RFQ (total 2500 BIDs) and 1 CREATEs per 1 BID (total 2500 BIDs) and 1 ACCEPT per RFQ (100 ACCEPTs)
   
       o	tx-size page contains the size of each transaction  


Folder named 20RFQ_15CAP_single etc contain the jupyter notebook files used to analyze the data produced through experiments on SmartChainDB. 


ETH-SC folder contains the data from experiments on SmartContract.
